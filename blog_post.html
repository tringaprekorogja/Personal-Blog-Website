        <h1>50 Most Anticipated Albums of 2020 </h1>
        <h2>From The Cure to Fiona Apple to Rihanna, everyone's roaring into the '20s</h2>

        <p>Only a few weeks ago, I was arguing that albums still meter.Now, looking at the initial slate staring back at us in 2020, I feel exactly the same way. I get goosebumps when I think of the albums Noname, Moses Sumney, and Frank Ocean might drop in our laps. I feel the same about the new depths and corners Phoebe Bridgers, Torres, and Lana Del Rey may mine and illuminate for us.</p>
        <p>I’m also just a sucker for stories. And 2020 looks to have plenty of those — enough so that everyone can find one narrative or another to embrace. Maybe it’ll be the story of J. Cole’s
            <em>The Fll Off</em> finally coming to fruition, the creative chaos that can be a Grimes album cycle, or someone like Hop Along’s Frances Quinlan stepping out into the spotlight. Maybe it’ll be Jon Frusciante finding his way home, Cardi B ruling the universe all over again, or Alanis Morissette returning to the studio just before setting out on one of the summer’s most anticipated tours.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>Hell, maybe you’re just curious how Huey Lewis & the News sound in 2020. My money is on
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt2BN9SeZsc">just too darn loud.</a>
        </p>
        <p>It really doesn’t matter what you’re excited for, though. Only that the thought — we’re still anticipating, after all — of sitting down with, singing along to, or dancing involuntarily under the spell of one or a dozen of these reported releases suddenly makes 2020 feel a little more tolerable. I’m sure we’ll catch each other as these stories unfold: in reviews, op-eds, and, hopefully, year-end lists (ugh, too soon, I know). But, just for now, let’s savor that sweet, fleeting anticipation that comes when we know we’re about to begin a story unlike any other.</p>
        <p>Happy listening in 2020.</p>
